Java Core Notes

# `When you make things faster it will make you slower`

# `Understand the concept, rather than memorizing the code`

Explicit = Manual  
Implicit = Automatic

# Why java is not fully Object-oriented
- Bacause of primitive types byte, short, int, long, float, and double.

# Access modifiers
- public: can be used anywhere in the program
- protected: can only be used by child class and not avaiable globally.
- private: only available inside the specific class it was declared on
- package-private: the default access modifier that only available in the specific package it was declared on.
#### Note: In inheritance access modifier cannot be more restricted than the declared one. for example

# Non-access modifiers
- final: use to declare a constant variable, non-overridable method and non-extendable class.
- static: is used to the variable and method, class that are not really binded in encapsulating class.

# Inheritance common words
- Sub class, Derived class and Child class are all the same.
- Super class, Base class and Parent class are all the same.

# Difference of this and super keyword
- this: is used to reference the methods and fields of current object.
- super: used to reference the methods and fields of super class.


# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
- Meaning is organize the structure of the code thats mimics real world objects via software objects that has their own behavior and properties.
